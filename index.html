            <p>“Gotta Catch ‘em All” is a phrase that was developed for a 1996 Game Boy game that quickly spiraled into an official motto that would eventually help shape a unique subgenre of role playing games. Originally, this phrase was designed for marketing the latest game at the time, Pokémon Red and Blue, it soon became a global phenomenon. More specifically, it would further encapsulate a type of gameplay idea that would go on to directly affect an entire subgenre of role playing games. Monster catching games are often identified by its core gameplay loop of the discovery, capturing, and the utilization of creatures in combat or progression. This particular approach to RPG mechanics has since expanded over time. Ultimately becoming a catalyst for many other similar games. As a result, Pokémon games have inadvertently inspired countless adaptations, iterations, innovations, and even evolutions of the mechanic.While more traditional RPGs usually emphasize a fixed party member line up and straightforward storylines, Pokémon games have instead flipped this narrative and taken the monster catching RPG to center around randomness, collection, customization and overall increased player agency through catching. From games such as Digimon and Yu-Gi-Oh! To more modern hybrids of the mechanic like Wuthering Waves and Palworld, the genre has become greatly diversified through each game’s iteration and implementation of the sub genre.

            <h2>Gambling In Gaming</h2>
            <p><strong>Published:</strong>Sep 18, 2024</p>

            <p>“As the gaming industry continues to grow alongside advancements in technology, leading to better game quality, graphics, and mechanics, game companies have gradually turned to alternative forms of monetization. While some games, like  Minecraft for example, provide free updates, many have also implemented digital game shops where players can buy items using in-game currency. In addition, paid add ons and expansion packs, commonly referred to as downloadable content, or DLC for short, have become popular in modern gaming. However, another highly profitable and controversial method has gradually arisen, loot boxes. The seemingly sudden emergence of loot boxes in gaming has sparked many intense debates, raising ethical concerns on player spending habits, and overall shaping modern monetization strategies. The loot box mechanic is also sometimes called a “gacha” game, more so referencing Japan’s small prize dispensaries called Gacha machines. Some may even say that it was inevitable that game studios would utilize the obsessiveness of physical gacha machines into digital mediums. Where a physical toy would’ve once been, it is now replaced by an in game character skin or rare item. Once considered harmless in game rewards, gacha and loot boxes have now evolved into powerfully effective monetization tools that encourage spending.
